# identify_aos4

This is a replica project aimed at duplication same set of features as the AmigaOS3.x M68K version of this library (written by Richard "Shred" Koerber).

The big difference is that this PowerPC library is written in C and amigaOS3.x m68k version is written in old school assembler.
this is why I can't cooperate much to the original library. But I hope we can agree on some things like ID numbers and so on.
I also hope to reuse what ever I can, but put as little as possible into this repo.

# Why?

* Because it’s useful to have common API’s and standards. 
* Because programs will not work without it.
* Because having a native version will allow people use it C programs.
* Becouse the 68K version crashes on AmigaOS4.x
